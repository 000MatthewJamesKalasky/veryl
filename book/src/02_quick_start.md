# Quick Start

Veryl has the almost same semantics as SystemVerilog.
If you are used to SystemVerilog, you will guess Veryl semantics with a small example source code.

This is a small example.
In the following example,  comments show the difference with SystemVerilog syntax.

```veryl,playground
module ModuleA (
    // name is first, and type is followed after `:`
    // bit width is represented by `<>`
    i_data: input  logic<10>,
    o_data: output logic<10>,

    // use `{}` instead of `begin`/`end`
) {
    assign o_data = i_data;
}
```

Some examples in the book have play button "â–¶" which will be appeared when mouse cursor is hovered at the code.
If you click the button, the transpiled SystemVerilog code will appear.

A source code of Veryl has some `module`, `interface` and `package` like SystemVerilog.
In this chapter, we'll show the some example source codes of them.
