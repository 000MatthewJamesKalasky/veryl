## Editor integration

[VSCode](https://azure.microsoft.com/ja-jp/products/visual-studio-code) and [vim](https://github.com/vim/vim)/[neovim](https://neovim.io) are supported officially.

* [vim/neovim plugin](https://github.com/dalance/veryl.vim)

Veryl provides language server. So other editors supporting language server (ex. Emacs) can use it.
